/// This module defines constants related to the voxel system.

/// The size of each voxel in the grid. This constant is used throughout the voxel-related
/// systems to determine the dimensions of the grid and the placement of individual voxels.
///
/// Example usage:
///
/// ```
/// use empire_of_wind::constants::voxel::VOXEL_SIZE;
///
/// let voxel_dimension = VOXEL_SIZE;
/// ```
