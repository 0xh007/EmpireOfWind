### Ship Collider Creation Workflow
This is the current workflow I'm using to create colliders for more complicated meshes (eg. the ships)

1. Select the ship object in blender
2. Edit mode
3. Select the faces that we should make the collider out of (eg walls, deck section)
4. Shift-D (Duplicate)
5. Esc
5. F3 -> Mesh > Separate > Selection
6. Move new object into colliders collection
7. Save off collider as separate glb
